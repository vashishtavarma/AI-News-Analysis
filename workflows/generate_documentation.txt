# Documentation Generation Workflow for AI-News-Analysis

## 1. Scan Codebase
- Recursively scan all Python files and Django project structure.

## 2. Gather Context
- Collect all docstrings and comments.
- Infer missing documentation from code structure and usage.

## 3. Draft Documentation
- Write a new README.md including:
  - Project overview
  - Key features
  - Tech stack
  - Architecture
  - API reference
  - Usage examples
  - Setup instructions
  - Migration notes
  - References
- Do NOT include commit message or 'Safety & Quality Checks' section in README.md.

## 4. Merge & Write
- Merge with any existing README.md, preserving custom content.
- Overwrite README.md with the new content.
